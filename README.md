# Student-library-management-system
This project is a console-based software designed to simplify the daily work of a  librarian. In many schools, library records are still kept in big registers, which makes  finding a book or calculating fines very slow and error-prone. My project solves this by  automating the entire process. It allows the librarian to digitally track which books.
